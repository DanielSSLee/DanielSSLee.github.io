    <h1>For project 1.1.9, our group coded a program called, "Draw by typing," where the player chooses which object to draw and select the colors of it.</h1>
    <h1>Our group divided the objects we chose to draw and came back together after coding our designated objects.   </h1>

    <h1>In 1.2.5, our group created wordsmith where the user has to type the right word to drop the cloud.</h1>
    <h1>This game used mostly lists and index to create three different turtles in a shorter amount of codes.</h1>

    <h1>Project 1.3.1 was straight to coding without any new stuff to learn, so we came up with the snake game.</h1>
    <h1>However, in our game, we added a spike that can kill you if the snake eats it so you have to avoid the blue one.</h1>
    <h1>We tried to add button so you can change the color but we didn't have time to put that extra work.</h1>

    <h1>Project Scratch was an alternate project from PLTW where we have to build a game through scratch and not python.</h1>
    <h1>This game is called Bubble Clicker! where you have to click the bubbles and you will gain a point.</h1>
    <h1>Everytime you click the bubble, the bubble teleports to somewhere else and changes size and the point you get depends on the size.</h1>
